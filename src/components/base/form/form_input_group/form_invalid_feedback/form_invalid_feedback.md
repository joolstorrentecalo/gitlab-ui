## GlInvalidFeedback

Uses BFormInvalidFeedback from Vue Boostrap

Invalid feedback text blocks for input invalid states.

The form valid feedback only displays when it is a post sibling of an input. This is problematic when using with other form components that deviates from this structure, such as `GlFormInputGroup`. That is where this component comes in handy. You can use it to display an invalid feedback as a block of colored text anywhere in your HTML structure.
