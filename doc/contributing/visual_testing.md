# Visual regressions testing

We use the [storyshots](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/addons/storyshots) addon
to generate and compare image snapshots based on [storybook](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook)
stories. `storyshots` runs in every pipeline in either of the following jobs:

* The `visual` job runs visual regression tests against all components. It always runs on the
  default branch and can be run manually in other branches. This job can take a while to complete
  and should only be run when absolutely needed.
* The `visual_minimal` job runs in MR pipelines and only tests the components that actually changed
  in the branch to avoid a time-consuming full visual regression testing suite.
  Note that if the changes affect a component that wasn't actually touched, `visual_minimal`
  might not report it. In such case, you might want to run the `visual` job manually to confirm that
  no regression is being introduced.

When component or dependency updates result in user-facing changes, visual regression tests fail.

Before proceeding make sure that the updated image snapshots:

* Still comply with the design system guidelines.
* Do not include any unexpected visual elements.

To inspect the image snapshots causing the pipeline to fail, browse the failing `visual` or `visual_minimal`
job's artifacts. The relevant snapshots are added in the `tests/__image_snapshots__/__diff_output__`
directory.

Once you have confirmed that visual differences are expected and aren't regressions, trigger the
manual CI job `update_screenshots` to regenerate the snapshots.

## Excluding stories from visual testing

If your story doesn't showcase any relevant UI components, you may want to exclude it from visual
regressions tests. For that use case, storyshots lets you skip visual tests for specific stories,
or for a whole component, using the `storyshots` parameter.

> **Note:** While skipping visual tests on given stories is a possibility, it is not meant to skip
> non-deterministic tests. If a story contains random elements, or any other variable that could
> lead to flakiness, you should make sure that it is deterministic in the test environment.

### Excluding a whole component

To exclude a whole component from visual tests, define the parameter in the default export:

```js
export default {
  title: 'base/accordion/accordion-item',
  component: GlAccordionItem,
  parameters: {
    storyshots: { disable: true },
  },
};
```

### Excluding a single story

To exclude a single story from visual tests, set the parameter in the story module:

```js
export const CustomActions = () => ({
  // ...
});
CustomActions.parameters = {
  storyshots: { disable: true },
};
```
