# Testing GitLab UI changes in GitLab

When introducing major, or potentially breaking changes in GitLab UI, you might want to verify that
they properly integrate in GitLab before they are released in a new `@gitlab/ui` version.

This can be done either by building the `@gitlab/ui` package locally, or by using the package that
is built every time a pipeline runs against your branch.

See [Updating GitLab UI Packages](doc/updating-gitlab-ui-packages.md) for information on how the
`@gitlab/ui` package is kept up to date in various other projects.

## Testing your changes in a local GitLab instance

During development, you can use [yalc](https://github.com/wclr/yalc) to  link your local
`@gitlab/ui` package changes to the GitLab project.
This means you don't need to update `package.json`, and can easily test changes.

1. Install `yalc` with `yarn global add yalc`
1. Navigate to the `@gitlab/ui` directory and publish the package with `yalc publish`.
1. Navigate to the `gitlab` project and add published package with `yalc add @gitlab/ui`.
1. Run `yarn install --check-files` to pull package updates.

To propagate changes in the `@gitlab/ui` project automatically to all installations use
the following command `yalc publish --push`.

## Using the remote development package

This approach relies on the development package that's built and published as an artifact by the
`build_package` CI job. This is especially useful if the changes you are making in GitLab UI require
some code to be migrated in GitLab as you will be able to open a GitLab MR to preemptively integrate
your changes before they are released with a new version of `@gitlab/ui`.

Your development flow would then look like this:

1. Push your changes to GitLab UI.
1. A development package is built by the `build_package` job.
1. Create a new branch in GitLab and install the development package.
1. Do any required migration in the GitLab branch, push it and open an MR against it.
1. Get your GitLab UI _and_ GitLab MRs reviewed.
1. Get the GitLab UI MR merged.
1. A new version of `@gitlab/ui` containing your changes is released.
1. Update the GitLab MR to use the newly released version of `@gitlab/ui` instead of the development
   build.
1. Get your GitLab MR merged.

To help with this process, GitLab UI exposes a `create_integration_branch` manual CI job that will
automatically create (or update) an integration branch and install the `@gitlab/ui` development build.

You would then only need to create a new Merge Request from that branch by following the link at
the end of the `create_integration_branch` job's output.

Once you create the GitLab integration Merge Request, add a note to the GitLab UI Merge Request
with a link pointing to it. This way, the reviewers can use the integration Merge Request to run
their own verifications.

> **Note:** When running the `create_integration_branch` CI job, integration branches are created
> in a [fork of GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/frontend/gitlab-ui-integrations).
> The fork is set up to mirror the `master` branch from the GitLab repository.
> We are using a fork to circumvent issues where pushing directly to the GitLab repository could
> time out. Therefore, keep in mind that the fork might be slightly behind the upstream branch
> between mirroring schedules. When working with such branches in your GDK, also bear in mind that
> changes need to be pushed to the fork, not the GitLab repository.
